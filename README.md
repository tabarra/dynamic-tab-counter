# Dynamic Tab Counter

This is a form from [@Loirooriol/tab-counter-plus](https://github.com/Loirooriol/tab-counter-plus) to add the functionality of changing the counter color/style depending on how many open tabs.  
I'm known for having a tad too many tabs opened at all times (most of the time above 100 across 4 windows) and I hope this very much "in your face" counter will help me keep the tabs under control.  
  
**Coding style disclaimer:**  
The original code was written very differently from how I would have written, and my added code kinda matches it. So please don't judge it.


## Changes from Original

- Removed the badge icon option;
- Wiped some (IMHO) dead weight files from the repo (test-related, but they were not testing anything?!);
- Added option to set threshold and styles to change the icon when the thresholds values are met.

## Maintainability

I make absolutely no promises of keeping this updated and working. I've made this fork just for myself and sharing it because I know at least one of my friends might want to try.  
This did not become a PR to the original repo because honestly I didn't want to deal with all the possibilities, specially considering @Loirooriol might not even care about it, but I definitely would prefer if this was an option on the original addon.
